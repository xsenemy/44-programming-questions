44 Programming questions Code

Ultra easy questions:

    1.  Print out your name on the screen.
    2.  Count down from 700 to 200 in decrements of 13. (Note: 90% of programming job applicants, and -50% of /g/, will fail here)
    3.  An array of integers has 10 elements. Print the second element of that array.
    4.  Sum all the integers from 0 -> 1000. Sum all the integers from [x] -> [y], assuming that "x" is smaller than "y".
    5.  Let the user input their [name] and check if it is "Jack". If it is "Jack", print out "Hi Jack!". Otherwise, print out "Hello [name]".
    6.  Utilizing the modulus operator, label all the even and odd numbers from 0-100. Do it again without the modulus operator. And a third time without using if/else/switch. (Note: 99.5% of programming job applicants. and 80% of /g/, will fail here)
    7.  Print the 12x12 multiplication table. (Challenge: Use only a single loop.)
    8.  Assume that the user will enter a moderately long (10+ words) sentence as input. Split this sentence into words, then display it as one word per line.
    9.  Generate three random integers, each between 0-20. Find the largest, smallest and average of the three.
    10. For a certain school class, you are given one test and an optional project. For the test, if you score below 50 (out of a 100), you get an F, 50-69 is C, 70-89 is B, and 90-100 is A. If you submit the optional project, you raise your grade by one letter. Let the user input their marks (0-100) and whether they submitted the project (Y/N), and give them their grade.
    11. Generate a list of 100 random integers, each between 0-10000. Enter a number and check if it is in the list.
    12. Write a program that lets you play "Higher/Lower" vs a computer. Take turns to see who chooses and who guesses.
       
Very easy questions:

	1.  Make a standard deck of cards. Shuffle the deck and draw two cards at random. Display the two cards. (Note: This is my hiring question for entry-level positions. If you can do this, you are hired.)
    2.  You are given an integer in the range of 0-10000, representing time in seconds. Convert it to time in the format of "HH:mm:ss".
    3.  Flip two coins, and note whether they land as two heads, two tails, or a head and a tail. Do this a thousand times and display the results as three percentages.
    4.  You have two arrays: A has 5 elements and B has 10 elements. Merge them into a single array.
	5.  After entering an initial amount of money and an interest rate, calculate how much money there will be after [x] years. Assume interest is applied once a year.
    6.  Generate a list of 200 integers, each between 0-10. Order it by size ascending, then by size descending. Now order it by mode ascending and mode descending. (Mode is the most frequently repeated number in a list).
    7.  Use recursion to divide one integer by another and also show the remainder. Do it again, and this time you must handle negative numbers.
    8.  Convert a number from a normal base-10 integer to Roman numerals (I, V, X. L, C. D, M). Assume that the number is between 1-2000.
    9.  Using only mathematical operations (no toString or similar methods), concatenate two positive integers.
    10. The numbers 121 and 123321 are palindromes. Check if positive integer [x] is a palindrome.
    11. The sum of all primes below 10 is 2+3+5+7=17. Find the sum of all primes below two million. (Extreme mode: Do this on a whiteboard.)
    12. Assume that you are retrieving an array of integers. This array has a size of 1000 and was supposed to be filled with all the unique integers from 0 to 999 in random order. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the person inputting the data, and we do not know if the array is actually full or not. We also know that one of the integers was repeated by mistake, while all the rest were unique. Find the repeated integer.

Easy questions:

	1.  Ignoring white-space, check if two strings are anagrams.
    2.  Find all the prime factors of a positive integer entered by the user.
    3.  Given an integer array of size 10, check if the integers are in ascending order, descending order, or neither.
    4.  Generate a very, very large random number. Check how many digits it has.
	5.  An MxN size array is filled with random integers. Check if any cell in the array is 0 and set all the cells in that cell's row and column to O.
    6.  Let the user enter an integer "n", then calculate "n" factorial (n!). Impose whatever limits on "n" that you feel necessary. (5! = 	5*4*3*2*1).
    7.  An array of size 100 is filled with random integers. Let the user pick an integer [x] between 0 and 98. Reverse the order of all the cells from [x] to [99].
    8.  The coordinates of the centres and radii of two circles are chosen randomly. At what points (if any) do the circles intersect?
    9.  Write an algorithm that plays the Towers of Hanoi with "n" disks.
    10. A mouse-and-cheese maze consists of an array of 100x100 cells. Each cell has 4 doors, which may be locked or unlocked to make the maze. The mouse starts at home in [0][0], the cheese is placed randomly and the doors to all cells are locked/unlocked to make a maze. Write the algorithm to help the mouse search for the cheese, then guide it back home, assuming that the mouse remembers every room it has been in before. (Hard 	(easy?) mode: The mouse has short term memory, and only remembers the direction of the room it just came from.)
    11. A square-shaped state is divided into 50 x 50 counties. By law, only one cinema is allowed per county. 20 cinemas have already opened, though their locations were chosen randomly. You want to open your cinema, but you are smart, and will choose a county that is furthest away from the 20 counties with cinemas in them. Write a program to help you solve this.
    12. Write a program that lets you play Tic-Tac-Toe vs a computer. Flip a coin to see who goes first. (Extra credit: The computer should never lose.)

Bonus questions (these do not affect your grade, just for fun):

    1.  Simulate a 3 x 3 "sliding pieces" puzzle. Scramble it randomly for n moves, then let the program solve it.
    2.  Simulate an 8 x 8 chess board that has the kings and queens and no other pieces. While obeying the standard rules of chess, let each piece move in a random direction, until there is a checkmate. If checkmate becomes impossible, declare a draw.
    3.  Generate a random integer [x] between 2-10. Solve Ultra easy question [x] using enterprise-grade code. (Extreme mode: Do this while someone is watching over your shoulder.)
    4.  In your programming language of choice, write a program that checks your code for syntax errors.
	5.  A histogram has 20 columns. Each column can be up to 10 units tall. Randomly generate the height for each column, then pour water all over it. Display the histogram with whatever water is trapped in it.
    6.  Create a non-trivial UI that the client will like on the first try.
    7.  Create a time-management program. Use it. For 5 years.
    8.  Write a program that lets you play 2-player Tetris vs a computer opponent.


Note: For all these code questions, your answers should use logic/algorithms that can be easily translated into any other common programming language. E.g. using "Java.util.toRoman(int)" or hashmaps is not acceptable.

To grade yourself for the above:

-If you get stuck on any of the ultra easy questions, you are not a programmer. Go back to school.

-If you get stuck on any of the very easy questions, you are a weakling programmer. Go back to books and study better, if you want to get hired.

-A prepared entry-level programmer will coast through ultra/very easy questions, but may need up to an hour (or two) for each of the easy questions.

-A mid-level programmer will breeze through all these questions without putting in much effort, because these are ALL easy questions.


Other Note: If you are a non-programmer, you might be wondering: How much programming skill is required to answer these questions? It is equivalent to a non-English-speaking person learning the ABCs. CS/IT students should find these questions easy after studying programming for a semester. A person who focuses exclusively on studying programming for two-weeks will similarly find these questions easy. Any programmer who has done real-world programming work for a few months will find these questions to be trivial, in the same way that the ABCs become trivial after a few months of learning English. A "programmer" who gets stuck on these is on the same level of skill as an "English-speaking" person who does not know the ABCs.
Credit: The majority of these questions came from /g/ or the internet. Thanks, /g/ and internet!
